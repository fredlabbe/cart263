**#Dusk of Conquests**
After having only B pluses for the last 2 projects, I really wanted to push myself for the last one to have an A. I wanted to do something different, something hard, something that has not really been done previously with Phaser 3. My two favorite types of games are RPGs/MMORPGs and RTSs. I realized that there was only 1 finished Phaser 3 RTS game, and the code is not public. Therefore, there was my challenge. After researching more about this type of game, I realized that the reason why not a lot of people attempted to do this type of game was because it is one of the hardest ones to program. There are a lot of things that do not come with Phaser, for example Pathfinding, follow other players, line of sight, radius detection, AI, combat, etc. Therefore, I decided that only the player was going to have a base that can produce units, and the enemies would just be spread in the map and the goal of the game would be to eliminate all of them. The idea of the universe of this game is based on a book that I have been writing for 9 years now, a medieval fantasy. This game is based around an era where elves conquered everything, so humans revolt and try to gain their freedom back, hence the name "The Dusk of Conquests" comes from the fact that the end of the Elves' conquests is near. This has lead to the idea of starting with only a base and then growing it and becoming a full fledge kingdom, like many mobile games around app stores. However, since it is pretty hard to do alone, I was going to program an early draft of an RTS, because that alone is pretty complex.

One of the major problems I had when programming the game was checking for when there is an overlap and when there is not. There is no isOverlapping Boolean (or any other following the same idea) property that can help to check during the update if something is not overlapping something else anymore then do something (like stopping sounds, or movement for example). After working for days on that and almost harassing my professor with questions (I’m sorry by the way), I finally had the idea of stopping the sound chopSFX when a unit is chopping wood when the unit is moving. Therefore, it means that if the unit is leaving the tree because it is fleeing from an enemy for example, then the sound will stop, and it makes sense because you can’t be chopping wood if you are moving. The same reasoning hence applied for the fightSFX, which makes also sense because it is hard to be fighting someone if you are running at the same time. Another problem was stopping the Elves when units were not overlapping their detection box anymore. I used the same reasoning to solve the problem, inside the overlap function check, when a unit is about to die, then the Elves would stop moving right before they die, leaving enough time for the unit to still be killed and to stay in the overlap check hence to stop.

I wanted to include more features, but I spent a whole week on trying to solve these issues, but I am still very happy of the result. I managed to program a type of game that seemed impossible even for Sylvain (shoutout Sylvain, you are a programming beast). It is a good early draft to expand on and maybe in the future create a full pledge RTS game.
