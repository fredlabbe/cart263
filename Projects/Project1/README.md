#While(Living) -> Badtripping
This game mirrors the myth of Sysiphus. Sysiphus is stuck in an infernal loop of failing to push a rock up a hill. The same idea is brought here, someone caught in a loop that is unpleasant, if not horrible at some point. This is a game about someone thinking that this time taking magic mushroom would be different than the last times. This time will be alright. This time there will be no bad trip. However, it does bring a bad trip, over and over again. And once it is over, the player thinks that the next time will b e different. And it is not.
